<!-- Hey! Good job checking out the HTML for the page! The structure should be pretty simple to follow. The body section consists
     of a single <header> section followed by a <section> for each exercise. Inside each <section> is a <div> with class
     exercise-header. This contains the descriptions of each exercise, and you mostly won't have to pay attention to HTML in
     those. Each <section> also contains a <div> with class exercise-body. These are the parts of the HTML that your code will
     interact with! So pay attention to them :) I've marked them all with comments -->

                <h1 class="page-title">Fun With JavaScript Loops</h1>
                <p class="page-description">
                    Here's a bunch of exercises which can be solved using JavaScript loops. The two types of loops you'll use are
                    <code>for</code> loops and <code>while</code> loops. A <em>loop</em> is a type of <em>control flow</em>, like
                    an <code>if</code> statement. <em>Control flow</em> instructions are special, because they give the computer
                    more information about the order in which normal instructions (like variable assignment or function calls)
                    should be executed. In particular, loops tell the computer to repeatedly execute some set of instructions
                    until a condition is met. This is true of both kinds of loops and, in fact, any problem that could be solved
                    with a <code>for</code> loop could be solved with a <code>while</code> loop instead (though it might not be
                    obvious how).
                </p>
                <p class="page-description">
                    English has looping structures in it, too, even though you might not think of them that way. Think of a recipe
                    for cake that instructs you to "stir the batter <em>until it is smooth.</em>" This is a lot like a while
                    loop:

                    <!-- "pre" stands for "preformatted," often used to embed code in pages. This means that any line breaks and
                         end up in the resulting HTML for the page! -->
                    <pre>

    while (batter is not smooth) {
        stir;
    }
                    </pre>
                </p>
                <p class="page-description">
                    Another example could be "pick up all that stuff off the floor" interpreted as a <code>for</code> loop.
                    <pre>

    var count = number of things on the floor;
    for (var i = 1; i <= count; i++) {
        pick up thing #i
    }
                    </pre>

                        All of the exercises in this document (except this one) have a corresponding JavaScript file where you will

                        This set of exercises also comes with solutions in the <code>solutions</code> folder. To see how a certain exercise
                        is supposed to work, you can replace the <code>src</code> in the corresponding <code>script</code> tag at the end of

                        be 15, because 15 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5. For 100 it should be 5050, because 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 99 + 100 = 5050. There

                        The Fibonacci numbers are a famous mathematical sequence named for the 11th century Italian mathematician
                        Leonardo of Pisa (also called <i>Fibonacci</i>, a nickname meaning essentially "Son of Bonacci"). The number
                        sequence is defined as follows: The first two numbers in the sequence are <strong>1 1</strong>. Every successive
                        number in the sequence can be found by adding up the two that come before it. So to find the 3rd Fibonacci
                        number, add the 2nd and the 1st to get <strong>2</strong>. Continuing this pattern produces<br><br>
                        <strong>1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 ...</strong><br><br>
                        Notice that every number equals the sum of the two before it. The answer in this exercise should be the N'th
                        Fibonacci number. For example, for 3 it should be 2 because 2 is the 3rd Fibonacci number. For 7 it should be
                        13, because 13 is the 7th Fibonacci number. There are ways to solve this without using a loop, but your solution
                        should use a loop.

                        number between the two as the "correct" number. Once the game starts, the user should be prompted
                        to enter a number. If the number is correct, they should get an alert "You win!". Otherwise, if the number
                        is too high they should be prompted "Too high! Guess again". If the number is too low they should be
                        prompted "Too low! Guess again". They should continue to receive prompts until they guess correctly.

                    <p class="exercise-description">
                        This is a two-part exercise in which you will write a Markov Text generator. A Markov Text generator takes in a document
                        (a sequence of words, in this case a paragraph from the Wikipedia article on George Washington) and then generates a new
                        document with similar statistical properties. This algorithm is very similar to the one used in modern devices to predict
                        the next word which will be typed based on the one that came before it. The results of basic Markov Text generation are
                        often humorous and word-salad like, in that every pair of words makes sense together, but as a whole the phrases meander
                        nonsensically.
                    </p>
                    <p class="exercise-description">
                        The algorithm is named for Andrey Markov, a Russian mathematician from the 1800's who produced a great deal of work around
                        processes like Markov Text generation. His research is widely used in fields like machine learning, behavior prediction,
                        and computational linguistics.

                    <p class="exercise-description">
                        To get started, we'll first need to know which pairs of words are possible. The idea of Markov Text generation is to always
                        pick a next word that completes a pair we've already seen. For example, if the input document was "I hate that I like you,"
                        we know that the word "I" can be followed by either "hate" or "like", but not "you". In this exercise, read the contents of the input box
                        with id <code>markov-1-input</code> and then, when the <i>Run</i> button is pressed, the span tag with id <code>markov-1-answer</code>
                        should be populated with a comma-separated list of all the words in the textarea that could follow the input word.

                    <p class="exercise-description">
                        For example, in the input document below, if the input word was "the", the answer should be "provincial, colonial, first, French, Second, Continental, American, British"

                        So now that you know how to find the possible subsequents for a single word, you'll need to find them for every word in the input!
                        Markov Text generation works by picking a starting word, and then randomly choosing the word to follow it from its possible subsequents.
                        Then doing the same with that word, and so on, until enough words of Markov Text have been generated.

                    <p class="exercise-description">
                        To do this, you'll first need an association between words and all the words that follow them. For example, if the input document was
                        "I know I want to go to the store, but I don't know what I want to buy," the association would be
                        <pre>

    know   -> I, what

                        Notice that following "I" the word "want" is represented twice. This is because "I want" shows up twice in the original document, so
                        "want" is twice as likely to follow "I" as the other two in the list. Starting with "I" and picking randomly from the associations,
                        we could for example generate "I don't know I want to go"
                    </p>
                    <p class="exercise-description">
                        In JavaScript, we store associations using objects. For example, let's say the first word we see is "I". To start off the association,
                        we'd write
                        <pre>

    var association = {};
    association['I'] = [];
                        </pre>
                    </p>
                    <p class="exercise-description">
                        This creates an object called <code>association</code>, and it starts off empty. Then we associate "I" with an empty list, because we
                        don't yet know what could follow "I."
                        Then if the next word is "want", we need to add that to the association. I do this using the <code>push</code> method of a JavaScript
                        array. At the end of this line's execution the value of <code>association</code> is <code>{ 'I': ['want'] }</code>
                        <pre>

    association['I'].push('want')
                        </pre>
                    </p>
                    <p class="exercise-description">
                        Once the association is completed for every word, the Markov Text can be generated as discussed before! To complete this exercise, you should accept
                        a starting word as well as a number, and then when the Run button is clicked, the <code>div</code> tag with id <code>markov-2-answer</code>
                        should be populated with that many words of Markov text generated from the input. As input, I've provided for you a document from three
                        sources: the lyrics to Jingle Bells, a snipped from the Wikipedia article on cats, and the first eight verses of Genesis from
                        the King James Bible.
                        When I ran it with this input, one of the phrases generated was "Dashing through the earth was good: and darkness he called the way;
                        oh! what fun it is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal," among other ridiculous things.
                    </p>

Dashing through the snow in a one-horse open sleigh. O'er the fields we go, laughing all the way. Bells on bob tail ring, making spirits bright. What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight! Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way; oh! what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh. Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way; oh! what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh.

The domestic cat is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than 70 cat breeds, though different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards.

In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.</textarea>
